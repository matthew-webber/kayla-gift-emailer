           ===== INFO =====

* Make sure you have the Altru export as a
  .csv file in the same folder as this script
  and that it's the ONLY .csv file.

* This script will start with the record
  on row $row_number and generate a
  "giver" email and "recipient" email
  for each record.

* It will iterate over $iteration_number records
  at a time, pause after each iteration,
  and ask to continue until you tell it
  to stop or until it reaches the last
  record.

* You can add optionial arguments to the run
  command to perform either of the following:

  1. the "starting row" AND "# of records", or
  2. the "starting row"
  
  * note: there is no "# of records only"
          argument 


Examples
--------

(start on row 10, process 5 records each iteration):

    python "C:\Users\your_home_folder_here\path\to\this\script" 10 5 (Windows)
    python path/to/this/script 10 5 (Mac)

(start on row 12, process default (3) records each iteration):

    python "C:\Users\your_home_folder_here\path\to\this\script" 12 (Windows)
    python path/to/this/script 12 (Mac)
