               NOTICE

* Make sure you have the .csv file in
  the same folder as this script.

* This script will start with the record
  on row $row_number and generate a
  "giver" email and "recipient" email
  for each record.

* It will iterate over $iteration_number records
  at a time, pause after each iteration,
  and ask to continue until you tell it
  to stop or until it reaches the last
  record.

* You can change which row the script
  starts on and how many records it
  will process at a time, or solely
  the row it starts on.  You cannot
  change solely the number of records
  to process each iteration.  See the
  examples below.

Examples:
(running from command prompt - start on row 10, process 5 records each iteration):

    python path/to/this/script 10 5

(running from command prompt - start on row 12, process default (3) records each iteration):

    python path/to/this/script 12

Enter 'start' to get started!
