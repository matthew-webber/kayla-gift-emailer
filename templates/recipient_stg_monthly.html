      The gift given on your behalf supports critical hospital operations and
      advances in rehabilitation and medical research that will improve our
      ability to save sick and injured sea turtles. It will enable the Aquarium
      to deliver new, core curriculum-based learning programs that redefine the
      way students, worldwide, experience conservation messages. Lastly, it will
      inspire the next generation of environmental stewards to ensure the future
      protection of threatened and endangered sea turtles and their habitats.
